Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow. It covers loading and exploring a dataset in Python, cleaning and preparing the data, executing SQL queries in PostgreSQL for deeper analysis, developing an interactive Power BI dashboard, and presenting findings through a structured report and a presentation built using Gamma.

The goal is to showcase practical analytical skills across the full data pipeline—from raw data to insights.

Dataset

Source: Insert dataset source (CSV, Kaggle, internal file, etc.)

Format: CSV/Excel/Other

Description: Brief explanation of what the dataset contains (e.g., customer transactions, sales records, survey data).

Key Columns: List a few important fields.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA

PostgreSQL: SQL queries and transformations

Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma: Presentation slides

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Development environment

Project Steps
1. Load Dataset

Imported the dataset using Python (Pandas)

Inspected shape, data types, missing values, duplicates

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Correlation checks

Trend and pattern identification

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Fixed inconsistent data types

Applied necessary transformations

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL

Executed queries to:

Aggregate key metrics

Segment data

Filter important business parameters

Join multiple tables (if applicable)

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Imported final cleaned dataset

Built visualizations like:

KPIs

Bar/Line charts

Filters/Slicers

Trend views

Designed an interactive dashboard for stakeholder use

6. Reporting & Presentation

Summarized insights in a written report

Created a clean, visually structured presentation using Gamma

Highlighted business implications and recommendations

Dashboard

Location: Add Power BI dashboard link or screenshot

Designed for quick insight discovery, focusing on actionable metrics.
